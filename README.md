## Snake in C with SDL

- A simple snake game with GUI components.

### Installation (for dev)
- Install [SDL](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation)
- If on debian based distro: ```sudo apt install libsdl2-dev```

### To run
- Just download the executable and run it.
- Or you can download the source code and compile it.

### Keep in mind
- Include SDL directories while compiling
- Link the libraries
- Take a look at Makefile (messy and unorganized)

- Inspired from [@DatacoreLinux](https://github.com/DatacoreLinux/)

Please add anything if you'd like.
